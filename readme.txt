FREP

F-Rep is a way of representing geometries and hypervolumes with a single function, which enables set theoretic operations and some interesting 
advantages over B-Rep, which is used in most CAD/CAM/FEA applications

TODO:
Define primitives
Create tree structure (main model for constructive geometry)
Figure out what math/number library to use (Zarith?)
Implement .obj library
Sample my function in a shrinking bounding box to get vertices for .obj
